    <th>OnePlus offers a specific discount for young adults aged 18 to 25. Unlike the student discount, you do not need to be in full-time education to qualify—you just need to prove your age. The discount usually gives you around 10% to 40% off specific products (often including the latest flagship phones or audio gear). You must verify your age using a platform called GoCertify by uploading a valid ID (like a driving licence).</th>

    <td>Unlike some networks that reduce your monthly bill, Mobile Phones Direct typically offers a one-off discount on the upfront cost of the phone (usually between £15 and £30). This helps lower the initial price you pay on the day you sign up for a new contract or upgrade, though your monthly direct debit will usually remain the same.</td>
